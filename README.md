# Relational-Factorization-Model

This package includes the implementation of **"Gromov-Wasserstein Factorization Models for Graph Clustering"** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08530]

The examples include clustering two graph datasets:
* AIDS (with node attributes)
* IMDB-BINARY (without node attributes)
